  [Valley of the Stars](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Golden+Gate+National+Park%2C+Golden+Gate+National+Park%2C+Free+State+9890%2C+South+Africa) in Golden Gate National Park, South Africa

![cosmogenesis.png](http://www.unifytheworld.com/assets/pages/23/cosmogenesis.png)

COSMOGENESIS is an event focused on TRANSFORMATION using shamanic tools including dance, music, meditation and ceremony. This cutting-edge event will occur at the most significant date in human history, the 21st December 2012. This date marks the end of the Mayan calendar and the birth of a new age... and on this auspicious occasion we are creating a festival of cosmic consciousness in South Africa called COSMOGENESIS, which means the birth of a new world.

The seeds of Cosmogenesis are to be found in many of us around the globe who feel attracted to this pivotal point in time, but Cosmogenesis was inspired by visionary psychedelic artist Carin Dickson, who has a deep calling to initiate a very special event for the 21st December 2012 in South Africa. This event is being created by the Global Psytrance community and like-minded people around the world, enabling all to participate in creating a powerful experience to shift the consciousness of humankind.

This event will harness the power of intention to focus the awareness of participants and observers around the planet on a new vision of reality for humankind on planet Earth. Everyone involved in this event, from the venue owners to the organizers, funders, volunteers, artists and healers are there for the same reason – to create a new awareness for humankind, a new vision of ourselves and our relation to our planet. The intention is to create a life-changing experience for all who participate in it, as well as those who resonate with it around the planet.

Other aspects of the event will introduce new ways of living and sustainability. There will be a healthy array of food provided through a community kitchen and food vendors all situated in a large shaded communal eating area. The intention here is to bring people together as we eat to create a real sense of community. People can also bring their own food to the event and look after themselves if they wish. The local community will provide a small grocery shop selling day-to-day supplies.

The festival will utilize food gardens on-site which will help to create awareness of the earth as the source of our food. Toilets and showers will be built using earth-friendly methods and the venue will be powered as much as possible with alternative energy sources.

There will be no alcohol on sale at the event. People who wish to drink can bring their own booze but no glass will be allowed. We will have a few refreshment stations offering interesting alternative energy drinks and refreshments.

The event starts on 12/12/12 and ends on 23/12/12.

Gates will be open to all passport holders on 11/12/12 and close on 24/12/12.

Other areas of interest:  
    
Visionary Art Gallery with artworks from international and local artists displayed.   
KidZone Children playcare area & separate family camp area.  
Healing Sanctuary, Market area, Restaurant at the Beginning of the Universe which will include a diverse array of meal options.  
Swimming Dam and a beautiful valley to explore.   
Secret sweet spots to discover for yourself.  
There will be no alcohol for sale. You are welcome to bring your own, quantities will be monitored and no glass allowed on site so please decanter all glass into plastic bottles before hand.

  [virtual meditation circle](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Mother+Earth%2C+Mother+Earth) in Mother Earth

The Global Meditation Wave for Peace will be on 12-12-12 at 6pm (local time). Join us! Please share with all your friends!  
https://www.facebook.com/events/323259154438146/?ref=ts&fref=ts  
    
12-12-12 is a very powerful day and is considered to be "the portal of the Golden Age of Peace." The Ancient Mayan Calendar spoke of 12-12-12 as the ending of one cycle and the beginning of another and is a beautiful time for personal and planetary transformation. This day marks a shift in consciousness on a global scale where people will start to live from their hearts. Soon we will

live in a world filled with compassion, unconditional love, joy, peace and universal oneness.  
    
You are invited to participate with us during the global meditation wave for peace, whether you can come in person or join us in spirit. Stay tuned to this page as groups announce specific event details for local events. If there is not a local meditation circle in your area, start one! Follow your heart and know that it is time for us to create the world of our dreams together! As we create peace within, we change the world!  
    
Let's continue to build the momentum that began across the globe on the September Equinox & the International Day of Peace, with the largest global meditation for peace in history. Thank you BeThePeace Global and MedMob for bringing the world together!

.........................................................................................  
    
THE GLOBAL MEDITATION WAVE FOR PEACE  
starts with a one-hour SILENT MEDITATION for world peace at 6pm, followed by a SOUND HEALING CIRCLE at 7pm, to help raise the vibration of peace around the world and uplift the entire planet.  
    
The SILENT MEDITATION  
will not be led by anyone as this is the time where we follow our own inner guidance and open our hearts to connect directly with the meditation that is perfect for us at the time. If one hour is too long for you to sit in meditation, please walk around or just enjoy the energy of peace and silence from the group. It is really wonderful to experience!  
    
THE SOUND HEALING CIRCLE  
begins at 7pm, right after the silent meditation. Please bring your drums, Tibetan bowls, bells, guitars, harps, rattles and anything else that makes a beautiful sound. Also, feel free to sing or chant. Every sound circle will hold a different vibration and will be really fun to create together as a group. Each sound circle is powerful! The vibrations of the music we create will help to raise the vibration of the entire planet!  
    
THE PEACE ALTAR  
will be decorated with flowers, shells, crystals, pictures, artwork for peace, signs that say "I AM PEACE", dreams, prayer flags, peace poems, statues and anything else that will help to radiate the energy of peace around our beloved planet. Please bring something to share for the altar.  
    
.........................................................................................  
    
If you are not able to physically join a group at 6pm for the Global Meditation Wave for Peace on 12-12-12, please join us in spirit. At 6pm (local time) wherever you are in the world, stop whatever you are doing, close your eyes and breathe deeply. Open your heart to connect with the Global Meditation Wave for Peace groups around the world. Hold the vibration of peace in your heart and let that ripple out in the world around you. BE PEACE!  
    
This is a gift for Mother Earth and for all life on Earth!  
    
Please share this message with all your friends and help to create meditation groups in your community for people to come together. When we come together in groups, we generate much more energy than if we meditate alone, and it is very powerful. Know that wherever you are during the meditation is absolutely perfect!  
    
Together we are creating the New Earth with love, light and peace.  
    
We are much more powerful than we think!  
We are the ones we have been waiting for!  
The time is NOW!  
    
We are collaborating with global meditation groups around the world for the Global Meditation Wave for Peace. Please visit their sites for more information.

#### [Teotihuacan: Awakening the Giant](http://www.unifytheworld.com/teotihuacan_awakening_the_giant)

Monday, December 17, 2012 at 12:00 PM

  [Teotihuacan](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Teotihuacan%2C+Teotihuacan%2C+State+of+Mexico+55800%2C+Mexico) in Teotihuacan, Mexico

In the place named Teotihuacan "where humans awake and become God," you have a chance to participate in the event of a lifetime-closing out the Mayan calendar and ushering in the new era-alongside international bestselling author Don Miguel Ruiz ("The Four Agreements") and his highly regarded family of Toltec teachers. 

Within the sacred site of Teotihuacan, on the outskirts of Mexico City, The Ruiz Family will host "Awakening The Giant" on Dec. 17-21, a sacred, powerful and intimate transformational experience that is equal parts spiritual learning experience, musical celebration and mystical gateway. 

The event is designed to allow families and individuals to participate in the awakening of humanity to its full power.

"Awakening The Giant" will be filled with inspiration of all kinds. And then on the Dec. 21, The Ruiz Family and their guests will usher in the new era. It begins with a 4 p.m. sacred ceremony celebrating the four elements (wind, earth, fire and water) and the fifth (spirit). Then at 5 p.m., the focus moves to releasing fear and the old paradigm, and welcoming the new world of truth and light...the moment of transformation.
